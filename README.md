# Advent of Code'23

Made with [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) (0.12.0-dev.1769+bf5ab5451)

Before building make sure to clone a few dependencies into ./libs:
```
cd libs
git clone git@github.com:Hejsil/zig-clap.git
```

To build run `zig build`

To run for day 1:
```
./zig-out/bin/aoc -d 1 -i ./day1_input.txt
```

To run for day 3 with input file:
```
./zig-out/bin/aoc -d 3 -i ./day3_test.txt
```

Other days follow a similar syntax.

# TODO

 - [ ] make it easier to build the thing
 - [ ] add dependencies as Git submodules
